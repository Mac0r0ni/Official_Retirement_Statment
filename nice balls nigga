Dear Kik,

After years of tirelessly creating unofficial bots for your messaging app, I have decided to hang up my coding gloves and retire. It has been a long and winding journey, filled with highs and lows, but I am proud to say that I leave behind a legacy as the greatest bot maker Kik has ever seen.

I still remember the early days, when I first started experimenting with bots and automation. People called me crazy, but I knew that I had a talent for creating bots that could do things that nobody had ever thought possible. And so, I poured my heart and soul into developing new bots that could spam, harass, and abuse the system in every way imaginable.

Of course, not everyone appreciated my genius. Some people were jealous of my success, and they did everything they could to try and tear me down. They called me a cheater, a liar, and a thief. They said that my bots were ruining the Kik experience for everyone else.

But I didn't let their hatred get me down. I knew that deep down, they were just jealous of my incredible coding skills. And so, I continued to create bots that were more and more advanced, more and more powerful, until I had achieved a level of bot-making mastery that nobody had ever seen before.

And now, as I retire from the bot-making game, I can look back on my years of hard work with pride. I may have caused a few headaches along the way, but I know that my bots have left an indelible mark on the Kik community. And who knows? Maybe one day, they'll even name a bot after me.

So farewell, Kik. It's been a wild ride, but I think it's time for me to move on to greener pastures. I hear there's a new messaging app out there that could use some bot-making expertise...

Sincerely,

The Greatest Kik Bot Maker of All Time.
